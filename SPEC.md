# Roostr — SPEC

Main SDD spec. Invariants (§V) bind all work. Product detail: `.notes/NEXTGEN-SPEC.md`.
Status legend: `.` todo · `~` wip · `x` done.

## §G — Goal

Telegram-auth collectible roosters. Hatch common rooster w/ unique gene combo → collect, upgrade,
arena, market; mint TON NFT later. Premium look via shared design system.

## §C — Constraints

- Stack: Next.js 15 (App Router) · MUI v6 · TS · i18n en/ru. Host: Vercel.
- DB: **Neon** (serverless Postgres) + **Drizzle ORM**, layer in `src/db/`. Picked for free-no-card +
  relational data + Stars ledgers later. Pages still on localStorage until migrated (→ T7).
- All UI on design system → see V1.
- Auth = Telegram `initData` → session JWT. No passwords.
- Code comments English-only.

## §I — Interfaces

- Routes: `/incubator` `/collection` `/roostrdex` `/market` `/arena` `/farm` `/raids` `/bank`
  `/about` `/debug` `/support` `/settings` `/profile` · `/[telegramid]` (public profile by id) ·
  `/[telegramid]/achievements` · `/[telegramid]/friends`. `/raids` = Coop & Dagger heist mode (V14).
  Friends moved off the sidebar into the profile (3-up block + "all friends" → `/[telegramid]/friends`).
- API: `POST /api/auth/telegram` · `POST /api/auth/logout`.
- Design tokens: `src/theme.ts` (single MUI theme).
- i18n dicts: `src/i18n/dictionaries.ts` (en+ru).
- Game data (`src/data/`): `BREEDS.json`, `SKILLS.json` (12 stats incl Stealth + Fertility),
  `GENES.json` (26; 3/family, Work has 5 incl 2 Fertility), `RELATIONS.json` (families↔skills↔roles,
  archetypes incl Thief, weight classes w/ statMods), `COSMETICS.json` (colors
  w/ fixed hex + per-color drop `weight` — exotics rare; + patterns). Genes + colors use bilingual
  `name {en,ru}` (name.en = canonical id, matches breed `geneAffinities` keys + `COLOR_HEX`).
  `roostr.ts`/`breeds.ts` read these — see V11.
- Hatch lib: `rollRoostr() → RolledRoostr` in `src/lib/roostr.ts`.
- Shared UI: `AppShell` · `StubPage` · `RoostrCard`.
- DB: `src/db/schema.ts` (users (+ `referredById`), roostrs, breed_discoveries, battles, `expeditions`
  (= raids/вылазки, V14), farm_sessions, friendships, achievement_unlocks (V-ach), referrals (V17)) +
  `src/db/index.ts` (Neon+Drizzle client). Scripts `db:generate|migrate|push|studio`. Env `DATABASE_URL`.

## §V — Invariants

- V1 — DESIGN SYSTEM = single source of truth for all UI. Every edit + feature built on it.
  Source `src/theme.ts` (one MUI theme "Neo-Arcade, Day Mode": palette w/ augmented `tertiary`
  `neutral`, `borderRadius`, headline/body font vars, component defaults). Use theme tokens + MUI
  components. No hardcoded color/space/radius/font in `sx`. New token/color/variant → extend
  `theme.ts` (augment custom palette there), then use — never inline ad-hoc. Reuse `AppShell`
  `StubPage` `RoostrCard`. User text → i18n dicts (en+ru). Visual not expressible by tokens =
  theme change FIRST, then usage. No drift between code + system.
- V2 — Every roostr hatches COMMON. Never born rare/legendary. Unique = combination only
  (breed + weight + colors + pattern + 2-4 genes). Power from прокачка, not egg. [.notes/GENE-MODIFIERS.md]
- V3 — Roostr has 1-4 key genes, weighted hard to 2 (~99.7%): 3 uncommon (~0.3%), 1 and 4 both
  super-rare (~1/50000 each). `GENE_COUNT_WEIGHTS` in `lib/roostr.ts` sums to 100000 = direct odds.
- V4 — Color/pattern = cosmetic only. No battle bonus (avoid "right color for meta").
- V5 — Hatch = spend exactly 1 EGG (1 egg = 1 hatch). NO money/coin hatch, NO daily cooldown.
  New player gets 1 starter egg at signup (`upsertUser` → `grantResource(egg,"starter")`, once).
  More eggs from farm (future). Server-enforced: `hatchAction` spends via `spendResource("egg",1)`
  (admin + no-DB bypass), refunds the egg on persist fail. `claimHatch`/cooldown removed;
  `users.lastHatchAt` legacy/unused.
- V6 — Code comments English-only.
- V7 — Debug/admin features gated by Telegram-id allowlist (`src/lib/admin.ts`, default `339784494`).
  `/debug` SERVER-gated (redirect non-admins, not just hidden nav). Admin-only UI (debug nav,
  roostrdex "reveal") hidden otherwise. Client admin flag = `AdminProvider`, sourced from server session.
- V8 — Dev fake-auth (`/api/auth/dev`, `DevLoginButtons`, JWT dev-secret fallback) is DEV-ONLY:
  ALL disabled when `NODE_ENV=production` (endpoint 404s, buttons render null, prod still needs real
  `JWT_SECRET`). Used to test admin vs non-admin locally without real Telegram. Dev login upserts
  with `overwrite:false` (insert-if-absent) so the fake admin can't clobber the real Telegram
  profile sharing id 339784494; real Telegram login upserts with `overwrite:true`.
- V9 — Each breed has exactly ONE fixed innate trait (buff/debuff), grounded in look/habitat/
  character, NOT upgradeable. Lives in `BREEDS.json` `trait` (`effects` = signed stat mods for the
  future battle sim). Distinct from genes (genes = upgrade branches; trait = permanent identity).
- V10 — Logged-in-only routes are SERVER-gated in `src/middleware.ts` (guests redirect → `/`):
  incubator, collection, roostrdex, market, arena, farm, friends, bank, settings, profile. Public:
  `/`, `/about`, `/support`, `/[telegramid]`. `/debug` gated separately by admin (V7). Sidebar
  visibility (layout.tsx) mirrors this gate.
- V11 — `src/data/*.json` is the single source of truth for game data (breeds, skills, genes,
  relations, cosmetics). Code reads/maps these; do NOT hardcode rosters or color hexes in `.ts`.
  Cosmetic colors are fixed (name = id, hex pinned) but the palette is broad on purpose.
- V12 — A roostr IS its "DNA passport" = `RolledRoostr` (breed, weight, colors, pattern, genes,
  stats, maxHealth, role, trait, seed). Stats derive: `BASE_STAT + Σ(geneLevel × statMods)`;
  leveling a gene scales its buffs AND debuffs (balance). Upgrade cost `round(10×1.6^(L-1))`, cap
  `GENE_MAX_LEVEL=10`. Logic in `roostr.ts` (`computeStats`/`computeMaxHealth`/`geneUpgradeCost`),
  not hardcoded per-screen. Overall level = TIER (D<C<B<A<S<R<X, thresholds in `RELATIONS.json`
  `tiers`) from `computeRating` = Σ skills + maxHealth × `HP_RATING_WEIGHT` (0.5) — HP at HALF weight
  so tiers track the BUILD (skills), not raw HP pools; monotonic (skills floor at 0, HP only grows →
  upgrades only add). Thresholds rescaled to the achievable range (max 4-gene+synth @L10 ≈ rating 180;
  old R650/X999 were unreachable): D0 C75 B95 A115 S135 R150 X175. No birth rarity (V2). Each gene has
  a sequential `no` = its DNA passport code.
- V13 — WORK STATIONS = one shared accrual engine (`src/lib/stations.ts`) behind the LAB and the FARM
  (and any future CONTINUOUS-ACCRUAL "assign roosters → earn a resource over time" mode). NOTE: raids
  (Stealth heist) are NOT here — a raid is a DISCRETE timed mission w/ risk, own system → V14.
  Per-station config in `STATIONS` (resource, driving stat, `ratePerDay` fn, `bufferCap`): farm =
  Fertility→eggs (exponential `2^((ΣFertility−30)/10)`, cap 5), lab = Intellect→science (linear
  ΣIntellect/day, cap 50). ANTI-CHEAT: a station's `pending` buffer accrues by TIME-IN-SERVICE
  (`pending += elapsed × ratePerDay`), settled on EVERY worker-set change (assign/remove) + on claim
  + by a daily cron (`/api/cron/stations`, guarded by `CRON_SECRET`) — each interval has a constant
  worker set so the time-integral is exact (placing a worker right before a payout credits only that
  time). ALL on SERVER timestamps (no client trust). Assigned roostr → `roostrs.status="working"`
  (leaves the roster + can't be upgraded → stat constant in service, like `listed`). Claim moves
  `floor(pending)` to the wallet via the ledger (`grantResource(resource,n,kind)`), keeps the
  fraction; buffer cap pauses production until claimed. Slots fixed 2, buy +1 → MAX 3 (shared,
  "soon"). DB: `work_stations` (userId×kind: roostrIds, slotsOwned, pending, lastSettleAt). Farm is
  the ONLY farmable egg source (besides starter/tutorial grants); hatch egg-gated (V5) → farm is the
  core loop; `Yield` removed → Intellect. Design [.notes/FARM-MODE.md]; onboarding carries early
  players [.notes/ONBOARDING.md], NOT a gentler curve.
- V14 — RAIDS = the Stealth payoff mode. Brand "Coop & Dagger" / «Перо и кинжал», route `/raids`.
  LORE: at night the sneakiest roosters slip over the fence into a neighbor's coop, grab anything that
  glints (coins, grain, stray feathers), home by dawn — unless spotted, then they lie low. Lib in
  `src/lib/raids.ts` (TBD), DB = existing `expeditions` table (rebranded raids/вылазки). FLOW: send N
  roostrs on a TIMED raid (duration D, server `endsAt`) → each goes `status="raiding"` (locked: off
  roster + unupgradeable, like `working`/`listed` per V13) → on/after `endsAt` claim the haul. PAYOFF =
  f(ΣStealth, Luck): Stealth → haul size + caught-avoid chance; Luck → rare-drop quality / jackpot odds.
  CAUGHT: chance rises as ΣStealth falls — caught ⇒ reduced/zero loot + cooldown ("lying low", roostrs
  unavailable a while). Reward = coins + occasional rare loot (feather/egg/sci/cosmetic) credited via
  the ledger (`grantResource`). ANTI-CHEAT: outcome + timing resolved on SERVER timestamps only (no
  client trust), like V13. DISTINCT from V13: a raid is a DISCRETE timed mission with RISK, NOT
  continuous accrual — Huge weight (−Stealth, V12/T25) makes heavy birds poor thieves (thematic).
  Tuning sketch (not binding): `haul ≈ base·(ΣStealth/30)·luckMult`, `caughtChance ≈ clamp(0.5 −
  ΣStealth·0.01)`. Product detail [.notes/NEXTGEN-SPEC.md]. PvP (next): the "neighbor" becomes a REAL
  player picked BLIND (T29); the victim's Defense Watch contests the raid → V16.
- V15 — NEVER compare a Postgres `timestamptz` by exact equality against a JS `Date` — Postgres stores
  MICROSECONDS (`defaultNow()`/`now()`), Drizzle round-trips a MILLISECOND `Date`, so a plain
  `eq(col, jsDate)` SILENTLY never matches and the guarded write no-ops. For an optimistic-lock / CAS
  on a timestamp (e.g. V13 station settle on `lastSettleAt`) compare at MS precision
  (`sql\`date_trunc('milliseconds', col) = ${jsDate}\``) or use a monotonic version column. Test
  `V15_*` greps the settle CAS. Root cause of B1.
- V16 — RAID PvP = CONTESTED + LOSS-CAPPED (theoretical next step; numbers TBD). A raid targets a REAL
  player chosen BLIND from N random candidates (no stats shown pre-raid, T29). DEFENSE WATCH = roosters
  a player puts on guard duty (2 slots, +1 paid — same slot model as V13/V14 raids, T30); more/stronger
  defenders lower robbery odds. RESOLUTION (T31) = ONE server-resolved contested roll: ATTACK =
  Σ(raiders' Stealth + Luck) vs DEFENSE = Σ(victim watch's combat skills + Intellect) + bounded RNG.
  Win attack ⇒ steal a SMALL CAPPED slice of the victim's COIN balance — NEVER a full drain, a floor
  shields low balances ("lose some money, not much"). Win defense ⇒ attacker leaves ~empty, victim
  coins safe. ALL server-resolved on server state (no client trust, like V13/V14); coin transfer via
  the ledger. UI lives in the `/raids` area (attack + manage watch). Exact formulas/caps TBD.
- V17 — REFERRALS. ATTRIBUTION: a share link carries `?ref=<inviterId>` (`addReferralParam`,
  `ShareProfileButton`); `ReferralCapture` (in layout) stores it (cookie + localStorage, 30d) and strips
  the param; on Telegram SIGNUP the callback reads the cookie → `upsertUser({referredById})`. A referee
  is attributed exactly ONCE and only if NEW: sets `users.referredById` + writes a `referrals` row;
  self-ref rejected, inviter must exist (`parseReferralId` + existence check). REWARDS go through the
  ledger (`grantResource`, kind `"referral"`), each paid ONCE, SERVER-resolved (no client trust):
  • DONE — REFEREE signup bonus: +1 egg + `REFERRAL_BONUS_COINS=50` coins (`upsertUser`, new + valid ref).
  • TODO — REFERRER (inviter) MILESTONES, each credited once per referee: (a) referee registers → +5
  coins [T33]; (b) referee hatches 3 eggs (lifetime) → +1 egg [T34]; (c) referee's FIRST battle → +75
  coins [T35]. IDEMPOTENCY: track per-referee milestone flags (extend the `referrals` row, e.g.
  `rewardedSignup/Hatch3/FirstBattle` booleans) so a milestone never double-pays. UI: a logged-out
  visitor with `?ref` sees an invite CTA + Telegram login on the profile page (`ReferralBanner`).
- V18 — RARITIES (theoretical next step; numbers/odds TBD). Collectible "rarity" items — discrete
  COLLECTIBLES, NOT a currency — that occasionally DROP from RAIDS (V14/V16) and the ARENA (battles).
  Held in the Bank (`/bank` has a "Rarities" block, currently "soon"); a player can STORE them or SELL
  them for coins (and later trade). Low drop odds, possibly Luck-influenced; ALL drops server-resolved
  (no client trust), credited via a dedicated `rarities`/inventory table (TBD). Exact items/odds/values TBD.
- V19 — SEASONS (theoretical next step; dates/data TBD). Time-limited EVENTS whose core draw is EXOTIC
  birds obtainable ONLY during the season — each seasonal breed has its OWN genes + stats (a data set
  distinct from / flagged within the base `BREEDS.json`/`GENES.json`). When the season ends the breed
  is no longer obtainable, but already-owned birds PERSIST → collectible scarcity. Still obeys V2 (a
  seasonal bird hatches COMMON; "exotic" = a rare BREED identity available only in the window, not a
  birth-rarity tier). Season window = server start/end timestamps (server-gated, no client trust).
  Distribution TBD (event hatch / drops). Exact breeds/genes/stats/dates TBD.
